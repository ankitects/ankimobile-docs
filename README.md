# Introduction

Thank you for buying AnkiMobile! Anki development would not be able to
continue without your support, so it is greatly appreciated.

Some basic concepts covered in the [computer
manual](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html) are not repeated
here, so please check it out if you have not already done so.

## Support

There are two ways to get help with AnkiMobile. Both are regularly checked
by Anki's developer, so please pick the one you prefer.

- There is a [new public forum](https://forums.ankiweb.net/c/ankimobile/10)
  (and an [old one](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/ankimobile) that is being phased out). This is a better choice for general usage questions, as other members of
  the community may be able to answer you faster.
- There is a [private helpdesk](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/private) - messages
  posted here will not be visible to other users.

## Privacy

No data you store in AnkiMobile is shared with us or other Anki users by
default. If you use the optional synchronization feature, please see
[AnkiWeb’s privacy policy](https://ankiweb.net/account/privacy).

## Translations

AnkiMobile's interface is available in a few languages other than English.
For information on changing the interface language, please see
[this knowledge base article](https://anki.tenderapp.com/kb/problems/ankimobile-interface-language).

If you’d like to help translate AnkiMobile into your native language,
your help would be most appreciated! Please see the
[translation guide](https://ankitects.github.io/translating/#/ankimobile/intro)
for more information.
