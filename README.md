# Introduction

Thank you for buying AnkiMobile! Anki development would not be able to
continue without your support, so it is greatly appreciated.

As mentioned on the app store page, AnkiMobile is currently intended to
be used in conjunction with Anki on your computer. While it is possible
to download shared decks, study, and edit the content of your notes,
certain actions are currently only possible on the computer version.
While this is expected to change over time, for now please ensure you
have access to a computer in order to perform some of the operations
mentioned below.

Some basic concepts covered in the [computer
manual](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html) are not repeated
here, so please check it out if you have not already done so.

## Support

There’s a dedicated [support site](https://anki.tenderapp.com/) for
questions, suggestions and bug reports.

## Privacy

No data you store in AnkiMobile is shared with us or other Anki users by
default. If you use the optional synchronization feature, please see
[AnkiWeb’s privacy policy](https://ankiweb.net/account/privacy).

## Translations

AnkiMobile's interface is available in a few languages other than English.
For information on changing the interface language, please see
[this knowledge base article](https://anki.tenderapp.com/kb/problems/ankimobile-interface-language).

If you’d like to help translate AnkiMobile into your native language,
your help would be most appreciated! Please see the
[translation guide](https://ankitects.github.io/translating/#/ankimobile/intro)
for more information.
