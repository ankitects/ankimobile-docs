<p>Thank you for buying AnkiMobile! Anki development would not be able to
continue without your support, so it is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Some basic concepts covered in the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net">computer

<p>There are two ways to get help with AnkiMobile. Both are regularly checked
by Anki's developer, so there's no need to post the same question on both
sites - please pick the one you prefer.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a <a href="https://forums.ankiweb.net/c/ankimobile/10">new public forum</a>
This is a better choice for general usage questions, as other members of
the community may be able to answer you faster.</li>
<li>There is a <a href="https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/private">private helpdesk</a> - messages
posted here will not be visible to other users.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="user-interface-language"><a class="header" href="#user-interface-language">User Interface Language</a></h1>
<p>AnkiMobile's interface has been translated into a few different languages. Your
iOS settings control which language AnkiMobile will appear in.</p>
<h2 id="wrong-language"><a class="header" href="#wrong-language">Wrong Language</a></h2>
<p>If AnkiMobile is not appearing in your desired language, please go to the <strong>iOS
Settings app &gt; General &gt; Language &amp; Region</strong>. In that section, you can specify
the languages you prefer. If you want English to be used in AnkiMobile, please
ensure English is listed above the language you don't want to see. If your
native language is not English, you can put your native language first.</p>
<p>You can see
the list of available languages on AnkiMobile's app store page.</p>
<h2 id="app-specific-settings"><a class="header" href="#app-specific-settings">App-specific settings</a></h2>
<p>If you are on iOS 13, you can also control the language on a per-app basis. For
example, if you want all apps on your device to appear in Chinese, but want Anki
to show in English, you can do this by going to the Settings app.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>iOS Settings app &gt; General &gt; Language &amp; Region</strong>.</li>
<li>If only one language is shown in the <strong>Preferred Language Order</strong> section,
add the other language you wish to use as the second preference. If you have
two or more languages shown already, you can skip this step.</li>
<li>Go back to the first screen of the iOS Settings app.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the list of apps at the bottom, and locate Anki.</li>
<li>Tap on Anki, and choose the language you wish to use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some users have reported that AnkiMobile did not appear in the iOS Settings screen
until they went into AnkiMobile's <strong>Preferences &gt; Review &gt; Notifications</strong> section and
enabled notifications.</p>
<h2 id="new-translations"><a class="header" href="#new-translations">New Translations</a></h2>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="cloud-sync"><a class="header" href="#cloud-sync">Cloud Sync</a></h1>
<p>Anki has a free cloud synchronization service called AnkiWeb that makes
it easy to keep your card decks in sync between mobile devices and your
computer. If you are an existing Anki user with cards on your computer,
syncing is the easiest way to start using those cards on your mobile device
as well.</p>
<h2 id="intro-videos"><a class="header" href="#intro-videos">Intro Videos</a></h2>
<p>Please check out these short videos that explain syncing:</p>

<h2 id="creating-an-account"><a class="header" href="#creating-an-account">Creating an Account</a></h2>
<p>To sync with AnkiWeb, you’ll first need to create an account. If you
have used AnkiWeb in the past, you can skip this step.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Visit <a href="https://ankiweb.net">https://ankiweb.net</a> and click the <strong>Sign Up</strong> button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type in your email address and a password of your choice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="computer-to-iphoneipad"><a class="header" href="#computer-to-iphoneipad">Computer to iPhone/iPad</a></h2>
<p>If you have decks on your computer and would like them to be synced to
AnkiMobile:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the computer version and click the sync button at the top right
of the Anki window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If prompted to upload or download, choose 'upload' to send your
cards to AnkiWeb. Please make sure you <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/media-files-may-take-time-to-sync.html">wait for media files to finish
syncing</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap Synchronize in AnkiMobile and then 'download' to grab the cards
from AnkiWeb. Please make sure you <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/media-files-may-take-time-to-sync.html">wait for media files to finish
syncing</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="iphoneipad-to-computer"><a class="header" href="#iphoneipad-to-computer">iPhone/iPad to Computer</a></h2>
<p>If you have decks in your phone/iPad and would like them to be synced to
the computer version:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Tap Synchronize in AnkiMobile and then 'upload' to send the cards to
AnkiWeb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the computer version and click the sync button at the top right
of the Anki window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If prompted to upload or download, choose 'download' to grab your

</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="subsequent-syncs"><a class="header" href="#subsequent-syncs">Subsequent Syncs</a></h2>
<p>If you have a lot of sounds or images on your cards, the first sync may take
some time, and until it completes, <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/media-files-may-take-time-to-sync.html">sounds and images may fail to
appear</a>.</p>
<p>After the first synchronization has completed, you can click the
synchronize button again any time you wish to synchronize your changes
to the cloud. Only changes made since the previous sync will be sent, so
subsequent syncs are a lot faster.</p>
<p>If you add some new cards on the desktop computer and want to sync them
to AnkiMobile, you’d repeat the same process: sync on desktop (or close
the program, as it syncs automatically on close by default), and then
tap the sync button on AnkiMobile.</p>
<p>The sync button will change colour when a normal or full sync is required.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="shared-decks"><a class="header" href="#shared-decks">Shared Decks</a></h1>
<h2 id="from-ankiweb"><a class="header" href="#from-ankiweb">From AnkiWeb</a></h2>
<p>To download a shared deck directly to your mobile device:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ensure you’re connected to the internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap <strong>Add/Export</strong> on the bottom left.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose <strong>Shared Deck List</strong>. AnkiWeb will open.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select a category, or type in a search.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap on a deck you’d like to study.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scroll down and tap <strong>Download</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safari will start downloading the file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When it’s done, tap on the download icon in the top right, then <strong>Open in Anki</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the import completes, your deck should be ready to study.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="other-sources"><a class="header" href="#other-sources">Other Sources</a></h2>
<p>If you've downloaded a shared deck from another website, or received it in an email
or messaging app:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tap on the file.</li>
<li>Locate the &quot;Open In&quot; or &quot;Share&quot; icon, and select AnkiMobile from the available options.</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-deck-list"><a class="header" href="#the-deck-list">The Deck List</a></h1>
<p>The deck list is the screen you see when you start AnkiMobile. It
displays a list of your card decks, and provides buttons for performing
various actions.</p>
<p>Next to each deck, two numbers are displayed. The top, green number
corresponds to how many cards are due to be reviewed again today. On a
deck you’ve never studied before, there won’t be any cards waiting for
review. The second, blue number, corresponds to how many new cards you
have to learn today. Anki will introduce 20 new cards a day by default,
and you can customize this number in the deck options if you’d like.</p>
<p>To study cards in a deck, simply tap on the deck, and AnkiMobile will
switch to study mode.</p>
<p>If you wish to rename or delete a deck, swipe your finger from right to
left over it, and buttons will appear.</p>
<p>At the top of the screen, you’ll see four buttons.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The question mark opens this help page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The graph icon opens the deck statistics screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The magnifying glass opens the card browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gear/cog opens the preferences screen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the bottom of the screen, there are two more buttons. <strong>Add/Export</strong>
allows you to download shared decks, add/create an empty deck, and
import/export .apkg files from iTunes. <strong>Synchronize</strong> synchronizes your
cards with the cloud.</p>
<p>The synchronize button will change color if you have made changes that
need to be synchronized to AnkiWeb, or if changes are waiting on AnkiWeb
that need to be synchronized to the device. One of the changes that Anki
synchronizes to other clients is the current deck, so tapping on a deck
will change the button color, even if you do not study any cards.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-study-screen"><a class="header" href="#the-study-screen">The Study Screen</a></h1>
<p>If you have not used Anki on a computer before, please have a look at
the first <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#videos">intro
video</a> before
reading on, as it explains the basic review process.</p>
<p>When you tap on a deck in the deck list, the study screen will load, and
if any cards are waiting to be studied, a card’s question will be shown
to you.</p>
<p>If you wish to change to a different deck, you can do so by tapping the
top left button. The next three buttons allow you to add cards, edit the
current card, and search/browse all cards.</p>
<p>The gear/cog in the bottom right will open up the <a href="study-tools.html">tools
screen</a>.</p>
<p>On the bottom of the screen you’ll see three numbers. From the left,
these correspond to new cards, learning cards, and cards to review.
These are explained in more detail in the intro videos for the desktop
program, so please <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#videos">check them
out</a> if you
haven’t already.</p>
<p>When you’ve looked at a card’s question and remembered the answer, or
decided you don’t know it, tap anywhere in the card area in order to
show the answer. When you do, the bottom area will change to display 2-4
answer buttons, depending on how you’ve answered the card previously.
The buttons will display the time a card will next be shown, so 10m
means &quot;10 minutes&quot; and &quot;5d&quot; means &quot;5 days&quot;. You can tap directly on
these buttons to choose a particular answer.</p>
<p>To make reviewing faster, you can also tap on the card in order to
answer it. For more information on the available taps and how to
customize them, please see the <a href="preferences.html#taps">taps</a> section.</p>
<p>If you are studying content for which it is useful to sketch something
before showing the answer on the card (e.g., characters in a foreign
language), AnkiMobile provides a feature called the 'scratchpad' (the
analogous feature is called the 'whiteboard' in AnkiDroid). You can
enable the scratchpad by tapping on the tools button, then &quot;Scratchpad&quot;.</p>
<p>When you’ve finished the cards that are due to be studied today, you’ll
be shown a congratulations message. If you have other decks, you can tap
the top left button to return to the decks list and select a different
one.</p>
<p>You can tap the home button to close Anki and save your progress at any
time, whether you have completed the day’s reviews or not.</p>
<p>If you have a bluetooth keyboard, you can use the keyboard to review.
Space will show the answer or answer Good, and 1-4 will choose the
answer buttons. You can also press 'r' to repeat the audio on the
current card.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="study-tools"><a class="header" href="#study-tools">Study Tools</a></h1>

<p>The study options can be accessed from the tools screen.
Almost all the options available in the computer version can also be
adjusted in AnkiMobile. For a description of what everything does,
please see the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html">computer
documentation</a>.
While some of the options have different wording, the behaviour is the
same as the computer version.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="adding--editing"><a class="header" href="#adding--editing">Adding &amp; Editing</a></h1>
<h2 id="adding"><a class="header" href="#adding">Adding</a></h2>
<p>To add cards to a deck, tap the &quot;Add&quot; button while reviewing.</p>
<p>The &quot;Type&quot; button at the top allows you to select the type of note you’d
like to add. For more information about note types, please see the
introduction in the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#note-types">computer version’s
manual</a>.</p>
<p>When you tap on a field, a keyboard will come up, allowing you to type
in information. You can use the next and previous buttons to move
between fields.</p>
<p>The toolbar has the following icons:</p>
<p><strong>B I U</strong><br />
Mark the text as bold, italics or underline.</p>
<p><strong>Fx</strong><br />
Remove formatting.</p>
<p><strong>Paintbrush</strong><br />
Only available in iOS 13+. Sets the text color.</p>
<p><strong>Paperclip/Camera</strong><br />

<p><strong>&lt;/&gt;</strong><br />
Reveals the underlying HTML that fields are comprised of.</p>
<p>When you’ve typed in the content of a note, hit the save button to add
it to your collection.</p>
<h2 id="editing"><a class="header" href="#editing">Editing</a></h2>
<p>To edit a note, tap the &quot;Edit&quot; button while reviewing.</p>
<p>The edit screen is similar to the adding screen mentioned above, with
some key differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is no note type selection button or deck selection button. If
you want to change the type of an existing note, you currently need
to do so with the computer version of Anki.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a &quot;Tools&quot; button at the top of the screen. Tapping on it
will allow you to perform actions on the current card or note.
Please see the <a href="study-tools.html#actions">action descriptions</a> for more information
on what each action does.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="browsing"><a class="header" href="#browsing">Browsing</a></h2>
<p>You can search or browse your deck by tapping the &quot;Browse&quot; button while
reviewing.</p>
<p>The browse screen will show all the cards in the current deck by
default.</p>
<p>You can type text into the search box in order to limit the cards
further. If you only wanted to show cards in the current deck that
contain the text &quot;hello&quot; for example, you’d modify the text so it says
<code>deck:current hello</code> and then tap return. If you wish to search across
multiple decks, you can remove the <code>deck:current</code> part.</p>
<p>AnkiMobile supports all the search strings that the desktop version of
Anki does, allowing you to perform quite complex searches. Some
examples:</p>
<p><code>tag:marked</code> show cards that with the tag &quot;marked&quot;</p>
<p><code>is:due</code> show only cards that are waiting for review</p>
<p><code>front:rabbit</code> show only cards where the front field is exactly &quot;rabbit&quot;</p>
<p>For a full list of the possibilities, please see the section in the
<a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/searching.html">desktop manual</a>.</p>
<p>Tapping the Filter button will reveal a list of filters you can apply,
like the side bar in the computer version. Tapping on a line will
replace the current search; you can also swipe on a line to add to the
existing search instead.</p>
<p>The Options button will allow you to change what is shown in the left
and right columns, and change the order cards are shown in.</p>
<p>The Select button allows you to select multiple cards at once, and then
perform actions on them like changing their deck, or suspending them.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="preferences"><a class="header" href="#preferences">Preferences</a></h1>
<p>The preferences screen can be accessed by tapping on the gear icon at
the top right of the deck list. It allows you to customize various
application settings and how AnkiMobile appears.</p>
<p>The Preferences screen is divided up into different sections, which are
covered below.</p>
<h2 id="syncing"><a class="header" href="#syncing">Syncing</a></h2>
<p>The syncing screen allows you to customize <a href="syncing.html">cloud synchronization</a> with
AnkiWeb.</p>
<p><strong>Sync Sounds &amp; Images</strong><br />
By default, AnkiMobile will sync sounds and images as well as your cards
and review history. If you disable this option, sounds and images will
not be synced by AnkiMobile.</p>
<p><strong>Full Sync</strong><br />
The full sync button allows you to force a full upload or download of
your cards. This is useful if you accidentally deleted some cards and
want to revert to the local or remote version, instead of having those
deletions propagate to other devices. After tapping the button, you’ll
be given a choice of whether you want to upload your collection or
download it from AnkiWeb. Please note this option only affects how
cards, notes and review history is transferred - it does not change how
sounds and images are synced.</p>
<h2 id="review"><a class="header" href="#review">Review</a></h2>
<p>The review screen allows you to customize how AnkiMobile behaves when
you’re reviewing cards.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback Ticks</strong><br />
Flash a tick or cross in the top right to confirm your answer choice.</p>
<p><strong>Tools Overlay Button</strong><br />
Show the gear/cog icon on the study screen. If you prefer not to see it,
you can assign the tools action to the top bar instead.</p>
<p><strong>Tools Overlay Position</strong><br />
Allows you to put the tools button on the left.</p>
<p><strong>Audio Buttons</strong><br />
Allows you to hide the play button that appears for each audio file
you’ve placed on the card. Useful if you’d rather replay audio via the
&quot;Replay Audio&quot; action bound to a swipe or tap.</p>
<p><strong>Always Duck + Ignore Mute</strong><br />
When enabled, AnkiMobile will quieten any music you have playing in the
background, and will automatically play audio even when the
mute/vibrate/silent switch is turned on.</p>
<p><strong>Answer Keeps Zoom</strong><br />
By default, if you have zoomed in on a card, the screen will zoom out
when you reveal the answer. If you enable this option, AnkiMobile will
not zoom out.</p>
<p><strong>Never Type Answer</strong><br />
If you have set up your cards to ask you to type in the answer (as
explained in <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/templates/intro.html">this
section</a> of the
desktop manual), AnkiMobile will display a keyboard on such cards and
allow you to check your answer. If you find typing on a mobile device
inconvenient, you can use this option to disable the keyboard for all
cards.</p>
<p><strong>Shake Action</strong><br />
Allows you to customize what happens when you shake your device. The
default action is to undo the previous answer.</p>
<p><strong>Double Tap Prevention</strong><br />
This option ignores a second tap when two taps are made in quick
succession, so that you don’t accidentally reveal the answer or advance
to the next card. If you review your cards very quickly, you may wish to
select a shorter detection time.</p>
<h3 id="scheduling"><a class="header" href="#scheduling">Scheduling</a></h3>
<p>These options affect the way Anki schedules cards in all decks.</p>
<p><strong>New/Review Order</strong><br />
Whether Anki should introduce new cards before, after, or together with
review cards.</p>
<p><strong>Day Starts</strong><br />
Controls when a new day starts and new cards become available. Default
is 04:00, which means new cards become available at 4AM.</p>
<p><strong>Learn Ahead Minutes</strong><br />
The number of minutes to look ahead when the only cards remaining to
review with a next repetition time in the future. The default is 20
minutes, which means cards due to show in 10 minutes will be shown
immediately if nothing else is available to show.</p>
<h3 id="notifications"><a class="header" href="#notifications">Notifications</a></h3>
<p>When enabled, Anki will display an alert at the selected time of day,
reminding you to study and telling you how many reviews are waiting.</p>
<h3 id="top-bar"><a class="header" href="#top-bar">Top Bar</a></h3>
<p>You can assign frequently used actions to the top bar for convenient
access. For an explanation of the available actions, please see the
<a href="study-tools.html#actions">actions list</a>.</p>
<h3 id="bottom-bar"><a class="header" href="#bottom-bar">Bottom Bar</a></h3>
<p><strong>Show Bottom Bar</strong><br />
Hides or shows the bottom area that shows the answer buttons and card
counts.</p>
<p><strong>Remaining Count</strong><br />
Whether to show the card counts when the question side of a card is
being shown.</p>
<p><strong>Answer Buttons</strong><br />
Whether to show the answer buttons on the answer side of a card.</p>
<p><strong>Next Times</strong><br />
Whether to show the next study time above each of the answer buttons.</p>
<h3 id="taps"><a class="header" href="#taps">Taps</a></h3>
<p>When you’re reviewing, you can tap on different parts of a card in order
to trigger different actions.</p>
<p>Anki divides the screen into 9 sections:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Top Left</p></td>
<td><p>Top Center</p></td>
<td><p>Top Right</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Mid Left</p></td>
<td><p>Mid Center</p></td>
<td><p>Mid Right</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Bottom Left</p></td>
<td><p>Bottom Center</p></td>
<td><p>Bottom Right</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each section can have a different action assigned to it if you wish, and
the taps when the question is shown are also different from the taps
when the answer is shown.</p>
<p>By default, AnkiMobile responds as follows when the question in shown:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Show Answer</p></td>
<td><p>Show Answer</p></td>
<td><p>Show Answer</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Show Answer</p></td>
<td><p>Show Answer</p></td>
<td><p>Show Answer</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Show Answer</p></td>
<td><p>Show Answer</p></td>
<td><p>Show Answer</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In other words, tapping anywhere on the screen will show the answer.</p>
<p>When the answer is shown, by default AnkiMobile responds as follows:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Answer "Again"</p></td>
<td><p>Off</p></td>
<td><p>Answer "Good"</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Answer "Again"</p></td>
<td><p>Off</p></td>
<td><p>Answer "Good"</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Answer "Again"</p></td>
<td><p>Off</p></td>
<td><p>Answer "Good"</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This allows you to tap on the left side of the screen to trigger the red
button, and the right side of the screen to trigger the green button.
Taps near the middle of the screen will be ignored.</p>
<p>You can assign frequently used actions to taps for convenient access.
For an explanation of the available actions, please see the <a href="study-tools.html#actions">actions
list</a>.</p>
<h3 id="swipes"><a class="header" href="#swipes">Swipes</a></h3>
<p>You can also swipe up, down, left or right across a card to trigger an
action.</p>
<p>To ensure swipes don’t interfere with your ability to scroll on a large
card or select text, a swipe must begin from the far left or right side
of the screen. Begin by placing your finger on the left or right side of
the screen, and then move it up, down, left or right to trigger the
relevant swipe.</p>
<p>With the default settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Swiping left displays the tools window</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swiping right returns to the deck list</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can assign frequently used actions to swipes for convenient access.
For an explanation of the available actions, please see the <a href="study-tools.html#actions">actions
list</a>.</p>
<h3 id="scratchpad"><a class="header" href="#scratchpad">Scratchpad</a></h3>
<p><strong>Ignore Fingers</strong><br />
When enabled, the scratchpad will only respond to the Apple Pencil.</p>
<p><strong>Undo Clears All</strong><br />
Reverses the behaviour of the undo button, so a quick tap clears
everything, and a long press clears the last stroke.</p>
<p><strong>Scratchpad Below Buttons</strong><br />
Whether the scratchpad should be placed above or below the bottom bar.</p>
<h3 id="auto-advance"><a class="header" href="#auto-advance">Auto Advance</a></h3>
<p><strong>Wait for Audio</strong><br />
Don’t advance until the current audio stops playing.</p>
<p><strong>Answer Action</strong><br />
Whether to bury the card, answer it, show a popup reminder, or do
nothing.</p>
<h3 id="gamepads"><a class="header" href="#gamepads">Gamepads</a></h3>
<p>From AnkiMobile 2.0.53+, you can control the study screen with a game controller
on iOS 13+. The controller must be suppored by iOS, and must provide an
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamecontroller/gcextendedgamepad">extended controller
profile</a>.
Controllers with fewer buttons can not currently be used.</p>
<p>The gamepads section of the preferences allows you to configure which
actions are triggered when each button is pressed. You can assign an
action to each direction on the d-pad, but the analog thumbpads can not
be customized - they will always scroll the card up or down.</p>
<h2 id="general"><a class="header" href="#general">General</a></h2>
<h2 id="theme"><a class="header" href="#theme">Theme</a></h2>
<p>The theme screen allows you to customize the bar colours AnkiMobile
uses. The available options will depend on whether night mode or iOS
13’s dark mode is enabled.</p>
<p>To customize the appearance of your cards, you’ll need to alter your
card templates. You can do this using the Card Template action in the
tools screen, or by using the computer version. For more info, please
see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1j1Zx0mXME&amp;yt:cc=on">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1j1Zx0mXME&amp;yt:cc=on</a></p>
<h2 id="profiles"><a class="header" href="#profiles">Profiles</a></h2>
<p>Profiles allow multiple users to study with the same device. You can add
profiles from the settings screen. To rename or remove a profile, swipe
to the left on it.</p>
<p>Each profile needs to be synced with its own AnkiWeb account. Please be
careful not to sync two profiles with the same AnkiWeb ID, as this could
lead to data loss.</p>
<h2 id="backups"><a class="header" href="#backups">Backups</a></h2>
<p>AnkiMobile will automatically create backups of your collection for you.
The backups include all your cards and statistics, but do not include
sounds or images, since they take up a lot of space.</p>
<p>The backup is taken in the background when you return to your device’s
home screen, or switch to another app. A backup will only happen if more
than an hour has elapsed since the last time a backup was created.
AnkiMobile will store the last 15 backups.</p>
<p>To restore from a backup, open the Backups section in the preferences,
and tap on the backup you wish to restore to.</p>
<p>It is also possible to customize the frequency and amount of backups
that are created, via the settings at the top of the backups section.
You can change 15 to a different number to adjust the number of backups.
Set it to zero to disable backups completely.</p>
<p>If you’re unable to get AnkiMobile to start due to a serious error, you
can still retrieve the backups from the iTunes file sharing area:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Connect your Apple device to your computer via the USB cable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open iTunes if it doesn’t open automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Locate Anki’s file sharing section with <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4094">Apple’s
instructions</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drag the your backup files from iTunes to your desktop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the computer version of Anki, create a new, empty profile via
File&gt;Switch Profile, and then File&gt;Import the latest backup
apkg from within that profile to confirm that it’s ok. If it is
corrupt, you can try a previous backup.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="check-database"><a class="header" href="#check-database">Check Database</a></h2>
<p>This will check your collection for a number of possible errors and fix
them if possible.</p>
<p>It also will remove any tags that are no longer used by any cards.</p>
<h2 id="check-media"><a class="header" href="#check-media">Check Media</a></h2>
<p>This scans all your notes for references to sounds and images, and then
checks to make sure that the sounds and images are available. It will
display a report letting you know of any sounds or images that are
missing, and any sounds or images that are not used by any cards. If you
tap the delete button, the unused sounds or images will be deleted.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="collection-transfer"><a class="header" href="#collection-transfer">Collection Transfer</a></h1>
<p>If you don’t have regular internet access, it’s still possible to copy
your collection back and forth between devices, though the process is
not as convenient.</p>
<p>Collection transfer works by importing or exporting <strong>all your
decks at once</strong>, in a special file called <code>collection.colpkg</code>.
You can export that file on one device, copy it to another device, and
import it there.</p>
<p>When you import a collection file, any existing content you have is
replaced with the contents of the file - it is a one-way transfer
from your other device.</p>
<p>This means that unlike syncing via AnkiWeb, you can’t make changes from
two locations at once and then merge them - you need to make sure you’ve
imported any recent changes from your other device before you make
changes, or you’ll end up losing the changes made on one device.</p>
<p>A workflow you would typically use is to export your collection
from your mobile device and import it into the computer version, make
modifications (such as importing a shared deck you downloaded to your
computer), and then export your collection and import it back into your
mobile device.</p>

<h3 id="export-the-file"><a class="header" href="#export-the-file">Export the File</a></h3>
<p>On your computer:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the computer version of Anki.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose <strong>File&gt;Export</strong> from the menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the <strong>Export​</strong> button. Make sure to leave &quot;All decks&quot;
and &quot;Include scheduling information&quot; turned on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anki will automatically create a <code>collection.colpkg</code> file on
your desktop. If the file is named something else like
<code>deckname.apkg</code>, please see the previous step again. If it
is called <code>collection.apkg</code>, that will work - your Anki version
is just old.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="transfer-the-file"><a class="header" href="#transfer-the-file">Transfer the File</a></h3>
<p>If your devices are on the same wifi network and signed in to iCloud, you can
use the AirDrop option in Finder to
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204144">AirDrop</a> the <code>collection.colpkg</code> file
to your mobile device.</p>
<p>If you do not have access to AirDrop, you can use
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210598">Finder</a> or
<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4094">iTunes</a> to drop the .colpkg file into
Anki's file sharing area.</p>
<h3 id="import-the-file"><a class="header" href="#import-the-file">Import the File</a></h3>
<p>If you AirDropped the file, AnkiMobile should have automatically
popped up and imported the file when you accepted it.</p>
<p>If you transferred the file via iOS file sharing, go to AnkiMobile's
deck list screen, and then:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Tap the <strong>Add/Export</strong> button on the bottom left.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose <strong>Import from iTunes</strong>, then confirm the replacement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you receive a message about &quot;No file found to import&quot;, please
check to make sure you put the <code>collection.colpkg</code> file in AnkiMobile's
file sharing section.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once complete, the decks on your device will have been replaced with the
decks from your desktop.</p>
<p>When you import a <code>collection.colpkg</code> file, Anki will avoid
copying any sounds or images if they already exist on your mobile
device, and are the same file size. This will make imports after the
first one considerably faster if you have a lot of media files.</p>
<h2 id="iphoneipad-to-computer-1"><a class="header" href="#iphoneipad-to-computer-1">iPhone/iPad to Computer</a></h2>
<p>On AnkiMobile, tap the <strong>Add/Export</strong> button on the bottom left of
the decks list.</p>
<h3 id="airdrop"><a class="header" href="#airdrop">AirDrop</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Choose <strong>Export to Share</strong>, and then choose <strong>AirDrop</strong>.</li>
<li>Select your computer. If your computer doesn't appear, make

</ol>
<h3 id="finderitunes"><a class="header" href="#finderitunes">Finder/iTunes</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Choose <strong>Export to iTunes</strong>, and tap <strong>Export</strong>.</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Open Finder or iTunes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Locate Anki’s file sharing section with <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4094">Apple’s
instructions</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drag the <code>collection.colpkg</code> file from Finder or iTunes to your
desktop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use File&gt;Import in Anki to import the file.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="text-to-speech"><a class="header" href="#text-to-speech">Text to Speech</a></h1>
<p>AnkiMobile 2.0.56+ supports using TTS tags in card templates. Please see
<a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/templates/fields.html#text-to-speech">the computer
manual</a> for
more information.</p>
<p>To get the best quality sound, please go to the iOS Settings app, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tap on Accessibility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap on VoiceOver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap on Speech</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap on Voice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap on the voice you want to use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is an (Enhanced) version available, download it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that Apple limit Siri to their own apps, so you will need to
pick a voice other than Siri.</p>
<p>The Voice section will only show options for your current language. To
add voices for other languages, tap on &quot;Rotor Languages&quot;, and after
selecting another language, you will have a chance to download voices.</p>
<p>Like regular audio, text to speech will not play automatically when your
device’s mute/vibrate switch is enabled.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mathjax"><a class="header" href="#mathjax">MathJax</a></h1>
<p>MathJax allows you to easily add mathematical equations to your cards.</p>
<p>AnkiMobile supports MathJax out of the box. Simply place something like
the following on your card:</p>
<pre><code>This is some text \(x^2\) with an inline equation.

An equation block:

\[\sqrt{-1}\]
</code></pre>
<p>More information is available in the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/math.html#mathjax">computer manual</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="custom-fonts"><a class="header" href="#custom-fonts">Custom Fonts</a></h1>
<p>AnkiMobile allows you to use non-system fonts on your cards. To set them
up, the desktop client is required. Please see <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/templates/styling.html#installing-fonts">the section in the
desktop
manual</a> for
more information.</p>
<p>Please note that AnkiMobile has to load the entire font into memory in
order to use it, and fonts for Asian languages can be quite large. If
you have an older device and notice AnkiMobile crashing frequently after
installing a font, you may have exceeded your device’s memory limits.</p>
<p>We have had reports from one user that no more than 3 fonts could be
embedded - this may be a limitation imposed by the system web libraries.
If you need access to lots of fonts, you may want to look at installing
the fonts into iOS instead.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="night-mode-styling"><a class="header" href="#night-mode-styling">Night Mode Styling</a></h1>
<p>By using the Edit Card Template action, it is possible to customize how
cards appear when night mode/dark mode is enabled.</p>
<p>If you wanted a grey background instead of black, you could use
something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.card.nightMode {
  background-color: #555;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you have a 'myclass' style, the following would show the text in
yellow when night mode is enabled:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.nightMode .myclass {
  color: yellow;
}
</code></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="url-schemes"><a class="header" href="#url-schemes">URL Schemes</a></h1>
<p>AnkiMobile supports URL schemes for opening third party dictionaries,
and for adding content to AnkiMobile from other applications.</p>
<h2 id="ankimobiles-url-scheme"><a class="header" href="#ankimobiles-url-scheme">AnkiMobile’s URL Scheme</a></h2>
<p>A 'URL Scheme' is like a link to a website, but it instead links to an
app. A simple example is:</p>
<pre><code>anki://
</code></pre>
<p>If you type this into Safari on your device, you’ll see AnkiMobile open
up.</p>
<p>From 2.0.30 onwards, AnkiMobile provides a scheme for adding new notes
to your collection. This can be used with dictionary apps that support
calling other apps via URL schemes, and with automation apps like
Workflow.</p>
<p>The scheme to add cards looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>anki://x-callback-url/addnote?profile=User 1&amp;type=Basic&amp;deck=Default&amp;fldFront=front text&amp;fldBack=back text
</code></pre>
<p>The first part must always be there:</p>
<p>anki://x-callback-url/addnote?</p>
<p>After the first part, keys and values are separated by an ampersand. The
following keys must always be provided:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>profile=&lt;profile name&gt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>type=&lt;note type name&gt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deck=&lt;deck name&gt;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fields are entered by prefixing their name with &quot;fld&quot;. So if your first
field is called &quot;Text&quot;, the key would be &quot;fldText&quot;. The field text is
interpreted as HTML, so if you wanted a newline in the text you’d use
something like &quot;line 1&lt;br&gt;line 2&quot;.</p>
<p>Special characters in the URL must be escaped. For example, if you have
spaces in a field, they must be represented with <code>%20</code>. If you’re using
the Shortcuts app, there is a URL encode action which you may find
useful.</p>
<p>The remaining keys are optional:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>tags=&lt;tags separated by space&gt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dupes=1 - if provided, allow a note to be added even if the same
content is on an existing note.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>x-success=&lt;url scheme for another app&gt; - use to automatically
return to another app after the note is added.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If a field you provide is a link to an image or audio file, AnkiMobile
will automatically download that media and place a link to it in the
field. Eg:</p>
<pre><code>fldFront=http://example.com/image.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>The link will only be downloaded if it ends with a recognized file
extension. If your link is to a dynamic webpage, you can add a fake
argument with the extension at the end, eg
<code>http://example.com/getImage?imgID=1234&amp;fakePath=foo.jpg</code>. Be careful to
escape the URL before including it in the URL scheme, as otherwise ? and
&amp; characters will be interpreted as part of the URL scheme instead of
the URL.</p>
<h2 id="dictionary-links"><a class="header" href="#dictionary-links">Dictionary Links</a></h2>
<p>The desktop version of Anki provides the ability to open a web page
based on the contents of a field, for easily creating a link to an
online dictionary site. This is documented <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/templates/fields.html#dictionary-links">in this
section</a> of
the manual, though please start from the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/templates/intro.html">cards &amp;
templates</a> section
as the above link assumes you have read it.</p>
<p>Like the desktop, AnkiMobile supports links to dictionary websites. In
addition to that, you can also link to different dictionary apps that
you have installed on your device using a URL scheme.</p>
<p>Some dictionary apps provide a URL scheme that allows you to provide a
particular phrase to search for. For example, an app called iDict+
allows the following type of URL:</p>
<pre><code>idictplus://?search=mysearchtext
</code></pre>
<p>If you have iDict+ installed and type that into Safari, iDict+ should
open up and immediately search for &quot;mysearchtext&quot;.</p>
<p>iDict+ also supports passing a return link. We can replace the above
with:</p>
<pre><code>idictplus://?search=txt&amp;scheme=anki://
</code></pre>
<p>If you type that into Safari, it will search for &quot;mysearchtext&quot; like
before, but will also provide a &quot;return&quot; button that when pressed will
open up Anki.</p>
<p>By taking that text and combining it with the instructions for the
desktop version linked above, it’s possible to have a link on your cards
that searches for a word in another app, and then allows you to return
to Anki when you’re done.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no standard for URL schemes: some apps implement
them, some don’t, and the way they implement them can different. For
example, in the app called &quot;Kotoba!&quot;, the URL scheme is:</p>
<pre><code>kotoba://dictionary?word=mysearchtext
</code></pre>
<p>Note how not only the app name differs but also the text after it, and
how Kotoba! doesn’t provide the ability to automatically return to the
app that opened it, meaning that you need to double tap the home button
and manually return to AnkiMobile.</p>
<p>Some dictionary apps publish their URL scheme in their documentation. If
you’re using a dictionary app that doesn’t, please contact the authors
and ask them for more information.</p>

<p>Once purchased, you can use AnkiMobile on multiple devices you own without having to pay again.</p>
<p>To do so, make sure the device is using the same Apple ID as you made the original purchase with, or is enrolled in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201060">family sharing</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the App Store on the device you want to install AnkiMobile on.</li>
<li>(on iOS 12 or below, tap on the Updates tab)</li>
<li>Tap on your profile icon in the top right</li>
<li>Tap on Purchased</li>
<li>If you have family sharing enabled, tap on the person who bought the app originally.</li>
<li>When you've located AnkiMobile, tap on the cloud icon to download it.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're on an older version of iOS, or the purchase is not appearing, you can attempt to purchase the app again. Provided you make the purchase with the same Apple ID as the original purchase or family sharing is correctly set up, after you attempt to purchase the app, you should receive a message saying the download is free.</p>
<h2 id="account-troubles"><a class="header" href="#account-troubles">Account troubles</a></h2>
<p>Apple do not provide us with any access to their systems, so we do not have the ability to help you recover an old account, or confirm a previous purchase you have made. If you have any trouble with the purchase or download process, please give Apple a call:</p>

<p>Any existing AnkiMobile user that syncs with AnkiWeb is welcome to become a beta tester - please just post a <a href="https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/private">private ticket</a> requesting an invite. If you sync AnkiMobile with a different AnkiWeb ID, please include your AnkiWeb ID in the message as well.</p>
<p>Switching between beta versions and stable versions will preserve any cards you have on your device. But just to be safe, please sync any changes you've made to AnkiWeb before switching versions.</p>
<p>Once you've received an invite, please accept it and install the TestFlight app from the app store. Using the TestFlight app, you can download the latest beta. As new beta versions are released, you will receive a notification, and can upgrade as you please.</p>
<p>If you would like to revert to the store version, you can go to AnkiMobile's app store page and tap on the cloud icon. Once you switch back to the store version, you will receive normal app updates as you did before.</p>
<p>If you no longer wish to beta test and do not want to receive further notifications, you can remove yourself using the TestFlight app.</p>
<p>If you experience any issues with the betas, please either post a <a href="https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/private">private ticket</a>, or post on the <a href="https://forums.ankiweb.net/c/beta-testing/13">Beta Testing section</a> of the forums.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/templates/styling.html#javascript">warnings</a>
that apply to the computer version also apply to AnkiMobile.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, another thing to be aware of in AnkiMobile is
that your code also needs to play nicely with AnkiMobile’s tap
detection. Taps on A/BUTTON elements, or elements that have an onclick
handler should work as you expect.</p>
<p>If you have other elements that must receive tap events, give them the
class 'tappable' to tell AnkiMobile 2.0.39 or later that it should pass
taps through to the element.</p>
