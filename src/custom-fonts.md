# Custom Fonts

AnkiMobile allows you to use non-system fonts on your cards. To set them
up, the desktop client is required. Please see [the section in the
desktop
manual](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/templates/styling?id=installing-fonts) for
more information.

Please note that AnkiMobile has to load the entire font into memory in
order to use it, and fonts for Asian languages can be quite large. If
you have an older device and notice AnkiMobile crashing frequently after
installing a font, you may have exceeded your deviceâ€™s memory limits.

We have had reports from one user that no more than 3 fonts could be
embedded - this may be a limitation imposed by the system web libraries.
If you need access to lots of fonts, you may want to look at installing
the fonts into iOS instead.
