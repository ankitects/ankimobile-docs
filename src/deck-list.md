# The Deck List

The deck list is the screen you see when you start AnkiMobile. It
displays a list of your card decks, and provides buttons for performing
various actions.

Next to each deck, two numbers are displayed. The top, green number
corresponds to how many cards are due to be reviewed again today. On a
deck you’ve never studied before, there won’t be any cards waiting for
review. The second, blue number, corresponds to how many new cards you
have to learn today. Anki will introduce 20 new cards a day by default,
and you can customize this number in the deck options if you’d like.

To study cards in a deck, simply tap on the deck, and AnkiMobile will
switch to study mode.

If you wish to rename or delete a deck, swipe your finger from right to
left over it, and buttons will appear.

At the top of the screen, you’ll see four buttons.

- The question mark opens this help page

- The graph icon opens the deck statistics screen.

- The magnifying glass opens the card browser.

- The gear/cog opens the preferences screen.

On the bottom of the screen, there are two more buttons. **Add/Export**
allows you to download shared decks, add/create an empty deck, and
import/export .apkg files from iTunes. **Synchronize** synchronizes your
cards with the cloud.

The synchronize button will change color if you have made changes that
need to be synchronized to AnkiWeb, or if changes are waiting on AnkiWeb
that need to be synchronized to the device. One of the changes that Anki
synchronizes to other clients is the current deck, so tapping on a deck
will change the button color, even if you do not study any cards.
