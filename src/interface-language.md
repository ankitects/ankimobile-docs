# User Interface Language

AnkiMobile's interface has been translated into a few different languages. Your
iOS settings control which language AnkiMobile will appear in.

## Wrong Language

If AnkiMobile is not appearing in your desired language, please go to the **iOS
Settings app > General > Language & Region**. In that section, you can specify
the languages you prefer. If you want English to be used in AnkiMobile, please
ensure English is listed above the language you don't want to see. If your
native language is not English, you can put your native language first.

You can see
the list of available languages on AnkiMobile's app store page.

## App-specific settings

You can also control the language on a per-app basis. For
example, if you want all apps on your device to appear in Chinese, but want Anki
to show in English, you can do this by going to the Settings app.

1. Go to the **iOS Settings app > General > Language & Region**.
2. If only one language is shown in the **Preferred Language Order** section,
   add the other language you wish to use as the second preference. If you have
   two or more languages shown already, you can skip this step.
3. Go back to the first screen of the iOS Settings app.
4. Scroll down to the list of apps at the bottom, and locate Anki.
5. Tap on Anki, and choose the language you wish to use.

Some users have reported that AnkiMobile did not appear in the iOS Settings screen
until they went into AnkiMobile's **Preferences > Review > Notifications** section and
enabled notifications.
