There are two ways to get help with AnkiMobile. Both are regularly checked
by Anki's developer, so there's no need to post the same question on both
sites.

- There is a [public user forum](https://forums.ankiweb.net/c/ankimobile/10).
  This is a better choice for most questions, as other members of
  the community may be able to answer you faster.
- There is also a [private helpdesk](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/private) for AnkiMobile.
  Messages posted here will not be visible to other users. If your question is about the computer version
  of Anki or AnkiWeb, please use the [user forums](https://forums.ankiweb.net) instead.
